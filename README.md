# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** is an end-to-end data analytics project focused on transforming raw accident data into meaningful insights. This project analyzes historical road accident data from **2021 and 2022** to identify trends, evaluate risk factors, and support data-driven decision-making for improved road safety.

Using **PostgreSQL** for data querying and validation and **Power BI** for visualization, the dashboard highlights key metrics such as total casualties, accident severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, lighting impact, and high-risk locations.
